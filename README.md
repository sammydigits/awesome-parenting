No old-wives tales. Just scientific, research proven parenting facts

Inutero

- Babies like to be left alone whilst in the womb.
- fact 

Newborn

- Language DVDs dont work, the words he hears have to come from you.
- Children should not be exposed to screens (TV/iPad/iPhone) until at least 2 years old.

Toddler

- If you want your child to do well at math in her later years, teach her impulse control in her early years.
- The greatest predictor of happiness is having friends. To make friends you must be good at decifering non-verbal commuincation (learning a musical instrument boosts this ability by 50%)
- 

Child

- Instead of paying your child to do chores, pay them to read books. "This book cost $20, if you read it i'll give you the $20 and you tell me what you learnt/experienced from reading the book"
